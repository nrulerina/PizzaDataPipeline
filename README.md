## 🍕 Pizza Sales Data Pipeline (Medallion Architecture)

### 🛠️ Project Overview
Designed and implemented a **Pizza Sales Data Pipeline** using the **Medallion Architecture**:
- **🏁 Landing Zone**: Initial raw data intake
- **🥉 Bronze Layer**: Loaded raw pizza sales data into **Microsoft SQL Server**
- **🥈 Silver Layer**: Cleaned and transformed data using SQL queries
- **📦 Output**: Extracted cleaned data into **Parquet** files for downstream analytics

### 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- 🗄️ Microsoft SQL Server  
- 🐍 Python  
- 📁 Parquet  
- 🧱 Medallion Architecture (Landing → Bronze → Silver )

### 🎓 Learning Experience
I had the opportunity to join a sharing session with a senior Data Engineer, where we learned to build an end-to-end data pipeline using the Medallion Architecture. We explored the **Landing Zone**, **Bronze**, **Silver**, and **Gold** layers, understanding their significance in scalable and maintainable data processing.
